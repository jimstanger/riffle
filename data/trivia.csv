1,"After hatching from eggs nestled in the stream's gravel, young salmon enter a stage where they remain hidden from predators while relying on a built-in nutrient source. What is the name for these larval salmon that still carry a yolk sac?",Alevin,Fry,Smolt,Fingerling
2,"Healthy watersheds rely on a critical transition zone where freshwater rivers mix with the saltwater of the sea, providing a rich ""nursery"" for juvenile salmon to grow and adapt. What is this vital coastal habitat called?",Estuary,Riffle,Culvert,Hyporheic Zone
3,"During the spawning season, female salmon use their tails to vigorously clear away silt and create a clean gravel nest to protect their eggs from predators and flowing water. What is the specific term for this underwater nest?",Redd,Grotto,Burrow,Clutch
4,"NOSC frequently plants native trees along riverbanks to restore the ""riparian zone."" Why is providing shade to the water considered one of the most critical functions of these healthy forest buffers?",It keeps water temperatures low,It provides a place for fish to sleep,It stops the river from flowing too fast,It attracts more seagulls to the area
5,"In a beautiful example of ecological connection, scientists have found nitrogen from the ocean inside the needles of trees deep in the Olympic National Forest. How do these ""marine-derived nutrients"" primarily travel from the water into the forest?",Salmon carcasses are moved by predators,Sea spray travels during heavy storms,High-tide flooding reaches the trees,Commercial fertilizer is used by settlers
6,"As juvenile salmon grow in their home streams, they develop a series of dark, vertical bars along their sides that help them blend into the dappled shadows of the riverbed. What are these camouflage markings called?",Parr marks,Smolt scales,Lateral lines,Girdle stripes
7,"Often referred to as the ""King"" of salmon, this species is the largest in the Pacific and is vital to the health of the North Olympic Peninsula’s ecosystem and local economies. Which species is it?",Chinook,Sockeye,Pink,Coho
8,"To restore natural stream complexity, NOSC often installs structures that mimic nature. What is the general term for the logs, branches, and root wads that fall into a stream to create deep pools and refuge for fish?",Large Woody Debris (LWD),Aquatic Sedimentation,Riparian Run-off,Riverine Detritus
9,"Salmon are famous for their incredible ability to navigate thousands of miles of ocean and return to the exact stream where they were born. Which sense do they rely on most for this ""homing"" instinct?",Smell (Olfactory memory),Sight (Landmarks),Echolocation,Sensing water pressure
10,"Below the visible stream, there is a hidden area of saturated sediment where groundwater and surface water mix, helping to regulate temperatures for salmon eggs. What is this specialized zone called?",Hyporheic Zone,Benthic Layer,Aquifer Entrance,Tidal Prism
11,"Before a young salmon can migrate into the saltwater of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, its body must undergo a complex internal transformation to handle the change in salinity. What is this process called?",Smoltification,Carbonization,Respiration,Desalination
12,"A healthy river is a series of different habitats. What do we call the shallow, fast-moving sections of a stream where water flows over rocks, creating the turbulence needed to oxygenate the water for eggs?",Riffle,Still pool,Man-made dam,River mouth
13,"While famous for their vivid purple and green spawning colors, this species is also known as ""Dog Salmon"" due to the large, canine-like teeth developed by the males. Which species is this?",Chum,Steelhead,Coho,Cutthroat
14,All the land on the North Olympic Peninsula—from the mountain peaks to the shoreline—that drains into a specific river or body of water is part of a shared system. What is the name for this geographic drainage area?,Watershed,Floodplain,Basin Floor,Tributary Map
15,"After emerging from the gravel, young salmon fry need plenty of protein to grow before their ocean journey. What is the primary food source for these juveniles while they are still in the freshwater stream?",Aquatic insects and larvae,Small types of seaweed,Microscopic plankton,Tiny pebbles for digestion
16,Climate change and a lack of riparian shade can cause stream temperatures to rise to dangerous levels. At what approximate temperature do salmon begin to experience significant heat stress?,64°F,55°F,75°F,82°F
17,"Known as the ""Tree of Life"" by local Coast Salish Tribes, this native evergreen is a cornerstone of our riparian restoration projects because it provides long-lasting shade and stabilizes riverbanks. Name this tree.",Western Red Cedar,Lombardy Poplar,English Holly,Scotch Broom
18,"When heavy rains wash fine sediment from roads or bare soil into a stream, the water becomes cloudy, which can smother salmon eggs. What is the scientific term for this ""cloudiness"" or lack of water clarity?",Turbidity,Salinity,Alkalinity,Viscosity
19,"Ecologists describe salmon as a ""keystone species"" because their presence is essential to the survival of the entire ecosystem. Approximately how many other species in our region rely on salmon for survival?",Over 130 species,Only 10 species,Exactly 50 species,All species in the world
20,"This species of salmon is known for its bright silver color in the ocean and its preference for spawning in small, clear forest tributaries and side channels. Which species is it?",Coho,Chinook,Pink,Chum
